In the examples that helped me understand how to host this vault I saw that they all started with some quote. This is the first quote I got using the [random quote generator](https://coda.io/@mark-davis/random-quote).

As of now the contents of the vault are quite limited as we only cover design patterns and certain design principles, but as time goes on I'd like to go through other topics.

#### Currently covered topics
- [[Overview|Design patterns]]
- [[SOLID principles|SOLID design principles]]

#### Future topics
- Concurrent programming and multithreading principles
- JVM architecture
- JIT inner workings

#### Design Patterns
- [[Overview]]
- [[SOLID principles]]
- **Creational Patterns**
	- [[Builder]]
	- [[Factory]]
	- [[Prototype]]
	- **Singleton**
		- [[Basic Singleton]]
		- [[Singleton Thread Safety]]
		- [[Multiton]]
